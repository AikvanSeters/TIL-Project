    "How did COVID-19 affect travel reasons within the different provinces in The Netherlands per month? \n",

    "\n",
    "SMART criteria\n",
    "\n",
    "Specific - This question will focus on how covid-19 infections affected the travel reasons within the Netherlands. The purpose is to find out if this indeed happened, and if so, how much and what categories faced the largest shift?\n",
    "\n",
    "Measurable - Outcomes of the dataset analysis will focus on (1) the different travel reasons, (2) the differences per province, additional: (3) the different age categories within the Netherlands, (4) the changed distance (for instance, someone is maybe more likely to travel more/less distance for a specific occupation during this period).\n",
    "\n",
    "Achievable - Different datasets will be used, gathered over the past years by different data collecting institutions (RIVM data on covid cases, CBS travel reasons).\n",
    "\n",
    "Relevant - Relevance because it is useful to gain insights in the shift in travel reasons within The Netherlands due to the corona pandemic.\n",
    "\n",
    "Time-Bound - This research question focuses on the time period 2018 (the period before corona) until and including the year 2021. The year 2022 is left out of the analysis since data is not gathered of this entire year yet. \n"
